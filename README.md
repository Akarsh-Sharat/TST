# TST

# Description:
Most of us agree that writing long paragraphs is boring & addition to that sometime we want to add customized voice in multiple places such as caller tune or explaing projects but recording our voices somehow dosen't feels nice .
So, as a technical person i tried to find a fun and technical solution (fun is important -_-). Whit my TST programme you can speak and convert it to text and copy that text and convert it to computerize voice.
So, basically TST converts text to speech and speech to text.
